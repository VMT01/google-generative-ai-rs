# Unofficial Google AI Rust SDK for the Gemini APIs

The goal of this project is to develop a software development kit (SDK) for the Rust language to interact with Google's Generative AI APIs. This SDK will provide Rust developers with an easy way to integrate Google's powerful generative AI capabilities into their applications.

## Benefits:

- Easy to use: The SDK is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing Rust projects.
- Powerful: The SDK provides access to the full range of features of Google's Generative AI APIs.
- Flexible: The SDK can be used for a variety of use cases, including text generation, image generation, and code generation.
- Efficient: The SDK is optimized for high performance and low resource usage.

## Features:

- Text generation: Generate text in a variety of styles and tones.
- Image generation: Generate images from text descriptions or existing images.
- Code generation: Generate code in a variety of programming languages.

And much more!
